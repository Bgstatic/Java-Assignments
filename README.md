# Java-Assignments
  This repository includes java projects.
  * Assignment-1 includes two small projects.
    - A program that outputs the equation of the perpendicular bisector of the line
      segment between two points.
    - A small Individual Retirement Scheme program called 'The Private Pension System', PPS.
  * Assignment-2
    - A program that allows a car salesman to enter a customer's choices regarding a new car and from that information, 
      itemize the costs of the choices and finally determine the total cost. 
  * Assignment-3 includes two small projects.
    - A program which takes a sequence of characters and draws the image they represent. The ‘b’s in the sequence are for printing a blank     character, ‘s’s for printing ‘*’ and ‘n’s for newline.  A digit before any of these characters shows how many times the character           should be printed, if the digit is missing, the character should be printed only once.
    - A program to print the letters W, X, Y and Z using the character of ‘*’ with the given size. The user will decide the given size.
  * Assignment-4
    - A small String Analyzer Program with a menu. The menu is like:\
        Welcome to our String Analyzer Program.\
        Please enter your menu choice:
         1. Count number of chars
         2. Print the words in a sentence
         3. Delete substring
         4. Replace substring
         5. Sort characters
         6. Hash code of a string
  * Assignment-5 includes two small projects.
    - A program which takes a number (N) from user, and rolls 10 fair six-sided dice, N times. To
      roll a single dice, you can simply generate a random number between 1 and 6. Use an array to tabulate
      the number of times each possible total (between 10 and 60) occurs. For example, if the number is 1
      for all ten dices, the total of them will be 10. Then print out a text histogram of the results, as
      illustrated below. A histogram is a graphical representation of a statistical distribution that shows
      how many elements fall into a set of values.
    - A program which have multiple stages. In the first part, The user needs to take a string from the stdin which shows the content of       a 2D array. This string should contain a set of numbers separated by dashes (-), and each number is used for a binary                   representation of a row. Then, generated binary digits are located to the corresponding row of your 2D array as in the example           below. If the user enters a string such as “4-1-7”, then the program should print the following grid:

                                              -------------
                                              | 1 | 0 | 0 |
                                              -------------
                                              | 0 | 0 | 1 |
                                              -------------
                                              | 1 | 1 | 1 |
                                              -------------
      After that there are some step operations which is related to the given 2D array such as swapping 2D array's elements based on           specific rule.
  * Assignment-6 
    - Simple Course Registration Program (includes OOP).
  * Assignment-7
    - A personal and product registration program for firms, factories, employers and employees (includes OOP).
  * Assignment-8
    - A program that creates a smart house with interactive smart furnitures like smart light, smart camera, smart security camera, 
      smart plug. The user can connect with smart furnitures and control them eaisly (Iot) (includes OOP and interface).
